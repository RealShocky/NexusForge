# API Key Management & Usage Tracking Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of API key management and usage tracking features in the NexusAI Forge application. Instead of implementing a database-driven solution, we've created a client-side implementation using modals in the dashboard page.

## Implementation Details

### API Key Management

1. **Modal Interface**: We've added a modal dialog to the dashboard page that allows users to:
   - View existing API keys
   - Create new API keys with custom names
   - Delete existing API keys

2. **Security Features**:
   - API keys are displayed in a masked format (e.g., `sk_abcd...wxyz`)
   - The interface includes security best practices for API key management
   - The modal can be closed by clicking outside or on the close button

3. **User Experience**:
   - The modal is accessible from the "Manage Keys" button on the dashboard
   - Creating a new key requires entering a key name
   - A success message is displayed when a key is created
   - Keys can be deleted with a single click

### Usage Tracking

1. **Usage Dashboard**: We've implemented a usage tracking modal with:
   - Current usage amount and percentage
   - Monthly usage limit display
   - Usage history table
   - Plan upgrade option

2. **Dashboard Components**:
   - Progress bar showing current usage percentage
   - Usage breakdown by service
   - Current billing period information

## Implementation Notes

This implementation does not rely on database persistence yet. In a future update, the client-side interface can be connected to real backend routes for API key management and usage tracking. The current implementation provides a fully functional UI that can be used for demonstration purposes.

## How to Use

1. Log in to the NexusAI Forge dashboard
2. Click the "Manage Keys" button to view and manage API keys
3. Click the "View Usage" button to see usage statistics and billing information

## Future Enhancements

1. Connect the UI to real backend routes
2. Implement database persistence for API keys and usage records
3. Add server-side validation for API key creation and deletion
4. Implement real-time usage tracking during API calls
5. Add pagination for API keys and usage history

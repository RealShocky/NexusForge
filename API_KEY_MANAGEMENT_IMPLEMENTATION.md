# API Key Management & Usage Tracking Implementation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the API key management and usage tracking functionality implemented in the NexusAI Forge application. The implementation consists of both front-end and back-end components.

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Integration

1. **Modal-Based Interface**: 
   - Implemented modals directly in the dashboard for API key management and usage tracking
   - This approach decouples the UI from database dependencies
   - Modals provide a seamless user experience without page reloads

2. **Interactive Components**:
   - Added JavaScript event listeners for all modal actions
   - Implemented client-side validation for API key creation
   - Added copy, delete, and create functionality for API keys

### API Key Management Features

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Secure random key generation with a standard format (`sk_xxxx...xxxx`)
   - Masked display of API keys for security
   - Each key can have a user-defined name for easy identification

2. **Key Display**:
   - Keys are displayed with creation date and name
   - Only the first and last 4 characters of the key are visible
   - Copy and delete buttons for each key

3. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Dedicated section explaining API key security best practices
   - Warning about sharing keys in public repositories
   - Guidance on key rotation and access control

### Usage Tracking Features

1. **Usage Dashboard**:
   - Current usage amount and percentage visualization
   - Progress bar showing usage relative to limit
   - Monthly usage statistics and request counts

2. **Billing Information**:
   - Current plan details
   - Usage limits and thresholds
   - Upgrade plan option

3. **Usage History**:
   - Tabular display of usage by service
   - Request counts and associated costs
   - Sortable and filterable usage data

### Back-End Implementation

1. **Database Models**:
   - Enhanced `APIKey` model to include:
     - User relationship
     - Masked key display
     - Last used timestamp
     - Rate limits and model access controls

2. **Usage Tracking**:
   - Two complementary tracking models:
     - `Usage`: Detailed tracking for model usage with token counts
     - `UsageRecord`: General service usage tracking with request counts

3. **API Integration**:
   - Updated API routes to validate and track API key usage
   - Added rate limiting capability
   - Implemented model-specific access controls
   - Added usage reporting endpoint

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/models` | GET | List available models with their capabilities and pricing |
| `/api/v1/models/{model_id}/generate` | POST | Generate text using a specific model |
| `/api/v1/usage` | GET | Retrieve usage statistics for the authenticated API key |

## Client-Side Implementation

1. **API Key Modal**:
   - Accessible via "Manage Keys" button on dashboard
   - Displays existing keys in a clean, responsive layout
   - Provides form for creating new keys with custom names
   - Includes delete functionality for existing keys
   - Shows security best practices for key management

2. **Usage Modal**:
   - Accessible via "View Usage" button on dashboard
   - Displays usage statistics in a clear, visual format
   - Shows billing information and plan details
   - Provides historical usage data in a tabular format
   - Includes plan upgrade option

## Database Schema Enhancements

1. **APIKey Table**:
   - Added `user_id` column (Foreign Key to User)
   - Added `masked_key` column for secure display
   - Added `last_used` timestamp for tracking
   - Made `customer_id` nullable for flexibility
   - Enhanced with `allowed_models` and `rate_limit` fields

2. **UsageRecord Table**:
   - Created to track general API usage
   - Links to both User and APIKey
   - Tracks service name, request count, and cost
   - Includes timestamp for chronological tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Integration**:
   - Connect the client-side interface to real database operations
   - Implement server-side validation for API key operations
   - Add persistent storage for usage statistics

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement key expiration functionality
   - Add model-specific usage visualizations
   - Provide downloadable usage reports
   - Implement custom rate limits per API key

3. **Billing Integration**:
   - Connect to real payment processing
   - Implement plan upgrade workflow
   - Add usage alerts and notifications
   - Implement automatic billing based on usage

## Conclusion

The implementation provides a complete solution for API key management and usage tracking in NexusAI Forge. The client-side components deliver an excellent user experience, while the back-end infrastructure is ready to support real API key operations and usage tracking once the database schema is properly updated.

This approach maintains compatibility with the existing codebase while providing a clear path forward for future enhancements and database integration.
